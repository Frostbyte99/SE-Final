# SE-Final

We will be using HTML, Php, Mysql, and WampServer to develop the restaurant reservation
system.
We will need to store: login info(user name, encrypted_password), client info (mailing
address, billing address, preferred diner #, earned points, preferred payment method),
available tables, company info; MySQL will be used to manage the database that stores
these values.
WampServer will be used to connect the MySQL database with the PHP and HTML website.
